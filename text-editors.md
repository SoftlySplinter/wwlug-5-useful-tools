### Text Editors

### Why not use a gedit or an IDE?

* Its not always possible (`ssh` to a server)
* Most CLI editors can be IDEs
* Because its fun\*

--

### Ed

* The standard UNIX editor.

(I just added it in because someone is bound to know)

--

### VI(M)

* Standard on most Linux distros.
* Free (as in thought and beer)
* Distinct edit modes
* Typically terminal-based.

--

### GNU Emacs

* Created by Stallman himself
* Free (as in thought and beer)
* Metakey chords
* Grew a GUI early on, but can be used in terminal.

--

### Nano/Pico

* Much simpler (hack and play).
* Less powerful.

--

### The Holy War

* Church of Emacs
  * ![](./st-ignu-cius.jpg)
* Cult of vi

At the end of the day it just comes down to personal preference really.
